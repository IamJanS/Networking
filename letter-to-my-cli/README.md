Dear CLI,

We go back decades. We had an intense and close relationship. From time to time I hated you because you didn’t do what I told you. And sometimes you even gave me wrong information which made me very sad! But most of the time I loved you. You allowed me to control the inner workings. You showed me all errors and events.  You always gave me direct feedback. You made me watch for hours, sometimes a whole night. At times we tried to make you work without a human companion. But you didn’t like to be automated, you are a human interface after all. You are built for the human touch. You were designed for me. You allowed me to take control.

Some people are telling me that you are old school. That there is no place for you in this world. They are laughing behind our back and whisper that you are stuck in time. But CLI, I think they are mistaken. They are right when they say you can’t be automated, I figured that out a long time ago. But we have machine-to-machine interfaces for this reason. APIs and whole devices modelled in YANG. We can use RESTCONF or NETCONF, we can make our work extremely efficient and automated. I love to work with Python and Ansible and automate away every repetitive task.

But CLI, I’m asking, what has this to do with us? I need you to do my work efficiently. You are not old-school. You are my human interface. Just like my keyboard is. Do they really understand our relationship?

With love,

Your admin
